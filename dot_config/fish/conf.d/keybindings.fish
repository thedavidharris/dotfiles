# Fish-style history search (built-in, no plugins needed)
# Up/Down arrows already work for history search in Fish

# Reverse and forward history search
bind \cr history-search-backward  # Ctrl-R: reverse search
bind \cs history-search-forward   # Ctrl-S: forward search

# Additional useful bindings can be added here
# Use `fish_key_reader` to discover key codes
